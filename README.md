# Palaeozoic_chondrichthyan_diversity

This repository contains all the data and R scripts to run the analyses in the manuscript entitled "The rise and diversification of Palaeozoic chondrichthyans is led by holocephalans". There are slight discrepancies between the code here and the code in the data supplement on Dryad which are mainly due to editing the shortened versions for dryad. 

If you have any questions or problems, please get in contact with me!
